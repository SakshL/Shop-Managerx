# Installation Guide 🔥

## ✅ Hosting Requirements

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>

  * [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) version 16.6 or higher, I recommend the latest STABLE version
  * A VPS would be advised, so you don't need to keep your PC/laptop/RasPi 24/7 online! [Click here for a Repl setup](<repl link>)).

</details>

## 🤖 Bot Requirements

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  **NOTE:** It is suggested to use the [Sharded (&Clustered) version](https://github.com/NotSaksh/Multipurpose-discord-bot/tree/sharded_with_mongo), if you plan on using it for a VERIFIED BOT (on more then 2000 Servers!)

  1. Download the [Source Code](https://github.com/NotSaksh/Bot-Manger/releases/latest)
     * Either by: `git clone https://github.com/NotSaksh/Bot-Manger `
     * Or by downloading it as a zip from the releases tab or a branch.

## 🤖 Configuration and Starting

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>

  **NOTE:** *You can do the exact same configuration inside of the `example.env` file, just make sure to rename it to `.env` or use environment variables!*

   1. Fill in all required data in `config.json ` **NOTE:** *If you're on replit.com, it is exposed to everyone!(use process.env instead)*
   2. Fill in all required data in the `.json` 
   3. You can adjust some settings in the other `.json` Files, **BUT PLEASE __KEEP__ MY CREDITS & ADS!** This is the only way on how my hard work is "revenued".
   4. Now start the bot by opening a cmd line in that folder and typing: `node .` or `node index.js`

## ❓ Where to get which Api-Key(s)
